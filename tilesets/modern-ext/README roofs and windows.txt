RPG Maker users - I ran out of room on A3 for all the roof tiles I wanted to put on there.  Some of them were moved to A4.  Darker tiles/upside down tiles are intended to be the "shadow side" of roofs.  May behave strangely so plan accordingly.

The autotiles at the bottom of A4 are windows - try them out, especially with shift-click mapping.  They're useful for oddly shaped buildings.
